# rosco-cpm68k

This project implements cpm-68k on the rosco_m68k single board computer.  At the moment its WIP and is non-funtional.

### My development environment:
Windows 11 machine running VirtualBox 6.1 and Ubuntu 21.1
rosco development toolchain from: https://rosco-m68k.com/docs/toolchain-installation
mame emulator from here: https://github.com/roscopeco/mame

Mame is extremely useful (i.e. essential) so you can run the debugger and trace the execution through the boot loader and cpm.
